FB Clone — Front Page Demo

This is a small, accessible Facebook-like front page demo with fake data.

Files:
- index.html — the main page
- css/styles.css — layout and styles
- js/script.js — small interactions (post creation, like toggle)

How to open:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use `open index.html` on macOS).

Notes:
- This is a static demo for layout and accessibility practice.
- No build step required.
